## Earning money with comfort

Everyone likes to earn extra money and stay healthy while executing the job. In my opinion, it is possible only from the task of a skillful player who will earn money but stay healthy. As in the world of badminton, the player who is trained may become a coach and earn extra money while stay being healthy. 

But, most of the athletes are not acquiring high educations due to their professional careers whereas, in the career path of ICS, some of the programmers do not need to attend the office in order to get income. They are able to do their jobs almost in all places such as when they are on vacation with their family or friends, they still able to do their programs. It means places will not be limited whenever they are working. This flexibility of not being bonded to one place has attracted me to study ICS.

## The Idea comes from experience

When I was young, my father trained me to be a badminton player due to his passion for that sport. I had to be trained in the footwork, physical strengths, techniques, accuracy and quick responses. These basic training will be useful for preparing me to be a skillful player in playing badminton. Whenever he was ill, he would be unable to do the coaching and all would be halted. 

Suddenly, I realized that if I would able to create a robot with AI which can move like human beings to be a coach and sparring partner, it will be useful for training the athletes. Previously, my schoolmates and I had been able to make a simple robot but I think it is still far from perfection as it moved slowly and without any programmed computer being installed. If it can be installed an AI, it will be closer to perfection.

## Why choose cs as my major

The reason I am interested in software engineering, it will make me realize my dream to be the programmer of that AI robot. In future, when I am graduated from my major in Computer Science, I believe that I will be able to do all the coding for the development of this program in which executes and controls all movements of that robot. Before this invention is being developed and realized, in my leisure time I will be able to coach the beginners and earn extra money. As a coach, I have to move around to deliver and hit the shuttlecocks for the entire coaching sessions which make me doing some physical exercises. In this way, I will be earning extra money while stay being healthy.
